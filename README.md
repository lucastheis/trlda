# MDLDA

A fast implementation of mirror descent for latent dirichlet allocation.

## Requirements

* Python >= 2.7.0
* NumPy >= 1.6.1

I have tested the code with the above versions, but older versions might also work.

## Installation

	python setup.py build
	python setup.py install

To test whether the installation worked, you can run the following.

	nosetests code/mdlda
